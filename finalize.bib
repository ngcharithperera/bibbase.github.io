 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a dynamic global information network consisting of Internet-connected objects, such as RFIDs, sensors, actuators, as well as other instruments and smart appliances that are becoming an integral component of the future Internet. Currently, such Internet-connected objects or 'things' outnumber both people and computers connected to the Internet and their population is expected to grow to 50 billion in the next 5–10 years. To be able to develop IoT applications, such 'things' must become dynamically integrated into emerging information networks supported by architecturally scalable and economically feasible Internet service delivery models, such as cloud computing. Achieving such integration through discovery and configuration of 'things' is a challenging task. Towards this end, we propose a Context-Aware Dynamic Discovery of Things (CADDOT) model. We have developed a tool SmartLink, that is capable of discovering sensors deployed in a particular location despite their heterogeneity. SmartLink helps to establish the direct communication between sensor hardware and cloud-based IoT middleware platforms. We address the challenge of heterogeneity using a plug in architecture. Our prototype tool is developed on an Android platform. Further, we employ the Global Sensor Network (GSN) as the IoT middleware for the proof of concept validation. The significance of the proposed solution is validated using a test-bed that comprises 52 Arduino-based Libelium sensors.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to connect billions of smart objects to the Internet, which can bring a promising future to smart cities. These objects are expected to generate large amounts of data and send the data to the cloud for further processing, especially for knowledge discovery, in order that appropriate actions can be taken. However, in reality sensing all possible data items captured by a smart object and then sending the complete captured data to the cloud is less useful. Further, such an approach would also lead to resource wastage (e.g., network, storage, etc.). The Fog (Edge) computing paradigm has been proposed to counterpart the weakness by pushing processes of knowledge discovery using data analytics to the edges. However, edge devices have limited computational capabilities. Due to inherited strengths and weaknesses, neither Cloud computing nor Fog computing paradigm addresses these challenges alone. Therefore, both paradigms need to work together in order to build a sustainable IoT infrastructure for smart cities. In this article, we review existing approaches that have been proposed to tackle the challenges in the Fog computing domain. Specifically, we describe several inspiring use case scenarios of Fog computing, identify ten key characteristics and common features of Fog computing, and compare more than 30 existing research efforts in this domain. Based on our review, we further identify several major functionalities that ideal Fog computing platforms should support and a number of open challenges toward implementing them, to shed light on future research directions on realizing Fog computing for building sustainable smart cities.},

The merging between Cloud Computing and Internet of Things named Cloud of Things will be the key to handle thousands of sensors and their data. One of the main challenges in the Cloud of Things is context-aware sensor search and selection. Typically, sensors require to be searched using two or more conflicting context properties. Most of the existing work uses some kind of multi-criteria decision analysis to perform the sensor search and selection, but does not show any concern for the quality of the selection presented by these methods. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of the SAW, TOPSIS and VIKOR multi-objective decision methods and their quality of selection comparing them with the Pareto-optimality solutions. The gathered results allow to analyse and compare these algorithms regarding their behaviour, the number of optimal solutions and redundancy.},

It is a common practice that such cloud platforms are only used by its owners to achieve their primary and predefined objectives, where raw and processed data are only consumed by them. However, allowing third parties to access processed data to achieve their own objectives significantly increases integration, cooperation, and can also lead to innovative use of the data. Multicloud, privacy-aware environments facilitate such data access, allowing different parties to share processed data to reduce computation resource consumption collectively. However, there are interoperability issues in such environments that involve heterogeneous data and analytics-as-a-service providers. There is a lack of both - architectural blueprints that can support such diverse, multi-cloud environments, and corresponding empirical studies that show feasibility of such architectures. In this paper, we have outlined an innovative hierarchical data processing architecture that utilises semantics at all the levels of IoT stack in multicloud environments. We demonstrate the feasibility of such architecture by building a system based on this architecture using OpenIoT as a middleware, and Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure as cloud environments. The evaluation shows that the system is scalable and has no significant limitations or overheads.},

 abstract = {The application of mobile computing is currently altering patterns of our behavior to a greater degree than perhaps any other invention. In combination with the introduction of power-efficient wireless communication technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), designers are today increasingly empowered to shape the way we interact with our physical surroundings and thus build entirely new experiences. However, our evaluations of BLE and its abilities to facilitate mobile location-based experiences in public environments revealed a number of potential problems. Most notably, the position and orientation of the user in combination with various environmental factors, such as crowds of people traversing the space, were found to cause major fluctuations of the received BLE signal strength. These issues are rendering a seamless functioning of any location-based application practically impossible. Instead of achieving seamlessness by eliminating these technical issues, we thus choose to advocate the use of a seamful approach, that is, to reveal and exploit these problems and turn them into a part of the actual experience. In order to demonstrate the viability of this approach, we designed, implemented, and evaluated the Ghost Detector—an educational location-based museum game for children. By presenting a qualitative evaluation of this game and by motivating our design decisions, this article provides insight into some of the challenges and possible solutions connected to the process of developing location-based BLE-enabled experiences for public cultural spaces.},

 abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions billions of sensors deployed around us and connected to the Internet, where the mobile crowd sensing technologies are widely used to collect data in different contexts of the IoT paradigm. Due to the popularity of Big Data technologies, processing and storing large volumes of data have become easier than ever. However, large-scale data management tasks still require significant amounts of resources that can be expensive regardless of whether they are purchased or rented (e.g., pay-as-you-go infrastructure). Further, not everyone is interested in such large-scale data collection and analysis. More importantly, not everyone has the financial and computational resources to deal with such large volumes of data. Therefore, a timely need exists for a cloud-integrated mobile crowd sensing platform that is capable of capturing sensors data, on-demand, based on conditions enforced by the data consumers. In this paper, we propose a context-aware, specifically, location and activity-aware mobile sensing platform called context-aware mobile sensor data engine (C-MOSDEN) for the IoT domain. We evaluated the proposed platform using three real-world scenarios that highlight the importance of selective sensing. The computational effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed platform are investigated and are used to highlight the advantages of context-aware selective sensing.},

 abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a dynamic global information network consisting of Internet-connected objects, such as radio frequency identifications, sensors, and actuators, as well as other instruments and smart appliances that are becoming an integral component of the Internet. Over the last few years, we have seen a plethora of IoT solutions making their way into the industry marketplace. Context-aware communications and computing have played a critical role throughout the last few years of ubiquitous computing and are expected to play a significant role in the IoT paradigm as well. In this paper, we examine a variety of popular and innovative IoT solutions in terms of context-aware technology perspectives. More importantly, we evaluate these IoT solutions using a framework that we built around well-known context-aware computing theories. This survey is intended to serve as a guideline and a conceptual framework for context-aware product development and research in the IoT paradigm. It also provides a systematic exploration of existing IoT products in the marketplace and highlights a number of potentially significant research directions and trends.},

 abstract={Over the last few years, we've seen a plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, products, and services make their way into the industry's marketplace. All such solutions will capture large amounts of data pertaining to the environment as well as their users. The IoT's objective is to learn more and better serve system users. Some IoT solutions might store data locally on devices ("things"), whereas others might store it in the cloud. The real value of collecting data comes through data processing and aggregation on a large scale, where new knowledge can be extracted. However, such procedures can lead to user privacy issues. This article discusses some of the main challenges of privacy in the IoT as well as opportunities for research and innovation. The authors also introduce some of the ongoing research efforts that address IoT privacy issues.},

 abstract = {New-generation mobile devices will inevitably be employed within the realm of ubiquitous sensing. In particular, smartphones have been increasingly used for human activity recognition (HAR)-based studies. It is believed that recognizing human-centric activity patterns could accurately enough give a better understanding of human behaviors. Further, such an ability could have a chance to assist individuals to enhance the quality of their lives. However, the integration and realization of HAR-based mobile services stand as a significant challenge on resource-constrained mobile-embedded platforms. In this manner, this paper proposes a novel discrete-time inhomogeneous hidden semi-Markov model (DT-IHS-MM)-based generic framework to address a better realization of HAR-based mobile context awareness. In addition, we utilize power-efficient sensor management strategies by providing three intuitive methods and constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), as well as partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)-based optimal methods. Moreover, a feedback control mechanism is integrated to balance the tradeoff between accuracy in context inference and power consumption. In conclusion, the proposed sensor management methods achieve a 40% overall enhancement in the power consumption caused by the physical sensor with respect to the overall 85-90% accuracy ratio due to the provided adaptive context inference framework.},

 abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of the Internet of the future and will comprise billions of intelligent communicating 'things' or Internet Connected Objects (ICOs) that will have sensing, actuating, and data processing capabilities. Each ICO will have one or more embedded sensors that will capture potentially enormous amounts of data. The sensors and related data streams can be clustered physically or virtually, which raises the challenge of searching and selecting the right sensors for a query in an efficient and effective way. This paper proposes a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model, called CASSARAM, to address the challenge of efficiently selecting a subset of relevant sensors out of a large set of sensors with similar functionality and capabilities. CASSARAM considers user preferences and a broad range of sensor characteristics such as reliability, accuracy, location, battery life, and many more. This paper highlights the importance of sensor search, selection and ranking for the IoT, identifies important characteristics of both sensors and data capture processes, and discusses how semantic and quantitative reasoning can be combined together. This paper also addresses challenges such as efficient distributed sensor search and relational-expression based filtering. CASSARAM testing and performance evaluation results are presented and discussed.},

Towns and cities are accommodating half of the world's population thereby creating tremendous pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large concentration of resources and facilities. Such environments attract people from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now become an overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The enormous pressure towards efficient city management has triggered various Smart City initiatives by both government and private sector businesses to invest in information and communication technologies to find sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things (IoT) has also gained significant attention over the past decade. IoT envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to use them for efficient and effective resource management in Smart Cities. Today, infrastructure, platforms and software applications are offered as services using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore the concept of sensing as a service and how it fits with the IoT. Our objective is to investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in technological, economical and social perspectives and identify the major open challenges and issues.},

 abstract={As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

 abstract = {The vision of the Internet of Things is to allow currently unconnected physical objects to be connected to the internet. There will be an extremely large number of internet connected devices that will be much more than the number of human being in the world all producing data. These data will be collected and delivered to the cloud for processing, especially with a view of finding meaningful information to then take action. However, ideally the data needs to be analysed locally to increase privacy, give quick responses to people and to reduce use of network and storage resources. To tackle these problems, distributed data analytics can be proposed to collect and analyse the data either in the edge or fog devices. In this paper, we explore a hybrid approach which means that both innetwork level and cloud level processing should work together to build effective IoT data analytics in order to overcome their respective weaknesses and use their specific strengths. Specifically, we collected raw data locally and extracted features by applying data fusion techniques on the data on resource constrained devices to reduce the data and then send the extracted features to the cloud for processing. We evaluated the accuracy and data consumption over network and thus show that it is feasible to increase privacy and maintain accuracy while reducing data communication demands.},

While data management during web and app-based use is already a challenge, as the Internet of Things (IoT) scales up, the number of devices ac-cessing and requiring personal data will go beyond what a person can manually assess in terms of data access requests. Therefore, new approaches are needed for managing privacy preferences at scale and providing active consent around data sharing that can improve fidelity of operation in alignment with user intent. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel agent-based approach to negotiate the permission to exchange private data between users and services. Our agent negotiates based on learned preferences from actual users. To evaluate our agent-based approach, we developed an experimental tool to run on people's own smartphones, where users were asked to share their private, real data (e.g. photos, contacts , etc) under various conditions. The agent autonomously negotiates potential agreements for the user, which they can refine by manually continuing the negotiation. The agent learns from these interactions and updates the user model in subsequent interactions. We find that the agent is able to effectively capture the preferences and negotiate on the user's behalf but, surprisingly, does not reduce user engagement with the system. Understanding how interaction interplays with agent-based automation is a key component to successful deployment of negotiating agents in real-life settings and within the IoT context in particular.

In this paper, we present Feed me, Feed me, an exemplar that represents an IoT-based ecosystem to support food security at different levels of granularity: individuals, families, cities, and nations. We describe this exemplar using animated videos which highlight the requirements that have been informally observed to play a critical role in the success or failure of IoT-based software systems. These requirements are: security and privacy, interoperability, adaptation, and personalisation. To elicit a wide spectrum of user reactions, we created these animated videos based on the ContraVision empirical methodology, which specifically supports the elicitation of end-user requirements for controversial or futuristic technologies. Our deployment of ContraVision presented our pilot study subjects with an equal number of utopian and dystopian scenarios, derived from the food security domain, and described them at the different level of granularity. Our synthesis of the preliminary empirical findings suggests a number of key requirements and software engineering research challenges in this area. We offer these to the research community, together with a rich exemplar and associated scenarios available in both their textual form in the paper, and as a series of animated videos (http://sead1.open.ac.uk/fmfm/).},

The data generated by the Internet of Things are valuable and have the potential to drive innovative and novel applications. The data streams coming from these devices will challenge the traditional approaches to data management and contribute to the emerging paradigm of big data. One of the most challenging tasks before collecting and processing data from these devices (e.g. sensors) is discovering and configuring the sensors and the associated data streams. In this paper, we propose a tool called SmartLink that can be used to discover and configure sensors. Specifically, SmartLink, is capable of discovering sensors deployed in a particular location despite their heterogeneity (e.g. different communication protocols, communication sequences, capabilities). SmartLink establishes the direct communication between the sensor hardware and cloud-based IoT middleware. We address the challenge of heterogeneity using a plugin architecture. Our prototype tool is developed on the Android platform. We evaluate the significance of our approach by discovering and configuring 52 different types of Libelium sensors.},

 abstract={Mobile devices are rapidly becoming the primary computing device in people's lives. Application delivery platforms like Google Play, Apple App Store have transformed mobile phones into intelligent computing devices by the means of applications that can be downloaded and installed instantly. Many of these applications take advantage of the plethora of sensors installed on the mobile device to deliver enhanced user experience. The sensors on the smartphone provide the opportunity to develop innovative mobile opportunistic sensing applications in many sectors including healthcare, environmental monitoring and transportation. In this paper, we present a collaborative mobile sensing framework namely Mobile Sensor Data EngiNe (MOSDEN) that can operate on smartphones capturing and sharing sensed data between multiple distributed applications and users. MOSDEN follows a component-based design philosophy promoting reuse for easy and quick opportunistic sensing application deployments. MOSDEN separates the application-specific processing from the sensing, storing and sharing. MOSDEN is scalable and requires minimal development effort from the application developer. We have implemented our framework on Android-based mobile platforms and evaluate its performance to validate the feasibility and efficiency of MOSDEN to operate collaboratively in mobile opportunistic sensing applications.

 abstract={We are currently observing emerging solutions to enable the Internet of Things (IoT). Efficient and feature rich IoT middeware platforms are key enablers for IoT. However, due to complexity, most of these middleware platforms are designed to be used by IT experts. In this paper, we propose a semantics-driven model that allows non-IT experts (e.g. plant scientist, city planner) to configure IoT middleware components easier and faster. Such tools allow them to retrieve the data they want without knowing the underlying technical details of the sensors and the data processing components. We propose a Context Aware Sensor Configuration Model (CASCoM) to address the challenge of automated context-aware configuration of filtering, fusion, and reasoning mechanisms in IoT middleware according to the problems at hand. We incorporate semantic technologies in solving the above challenges. We demonstrate the feasibility and the scalability of our approach through a prototype implementation based on an IoT middleware called Global Sensor Networks (GSN), though our model can be generalized into any other middleware platform. We evaluate CASCoM in agriculture domain and measure both performance in terms of usability and computational complexity.},

 abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of Future Internet and will comprise many billions of Internet Connected Objects (ICO) or `things' where things can sense, communicate, compute and potentially actuate as well as have intelligence, multi-modal interfaces, physical/ virtual identities and attributes. Collecting data from these objects is an important task as it allows software systems to understand the environment better. Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones). In this paper, we propose Mobile Sensor Data Processing Engine (MOSDEN), an plug-in-based IoT middleware for mobile devices, that allows to collect and process sensor data without programming efforts. Our architecture also supports sensing as a service model. We present the results of the evaluations that demonstrate its suitability towards real world deployments. Our proposed middleware is built on Android platform.},

 abstract={As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a substantial acceleration of the growth rate in the future. It is also evident that the increasing number of IoT middleware solutions are developed in both research and commercial environments. However, sensor search and selection remain a critical requirement and a challenge. In this paper, we present CASSARAM, a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model for Internet of Things to address the research challenges of selecting sensors when large numbers of sensors with overlapping and sometimes redundant functionality are available. CASSARAM proposes the search and selection of sensors based on user priorities. CASSARAM considers a broad range of characteristics of sensors for search such as reliability, accuracy, battery life just to name a few. Our approach utilises both semantic querying and quantitative reasoning techniques. User priority based weighted Euclidean distance comparison in multidimensional space technique is used to index and rank sensors. Our objectives are to highlight the importance of sensor search in IoT paradigm, identify important characteristics of both sensors and data acquisition processes which help to select sensors, understand how semantic and statistical reasoning can be combined together to address this problem in an efficient manner. We developed a tool called CASSARA to evaluate the proposed model in terms of resource consumption and response time.},

 year={2013}, 
 pages={473-478}, 
 abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) envisions billions of sensors to be connected to the Internet. By deploying intelligent low-level computational devices such as mobile phones in-between sensors and cloud servers, we can reduce data communication with the use of intelligent processing such as fusing and filtering sensor data, which saves significant amount of energy. This is also ideal for real world sensor deployments where connecting sensors directly to a computer or to the Internet is not practical. Most of the leading IoT middleware solutions require manual and labour intensive tasks to be completed in order to connect a mobile phone to them. In this paper we present a mobile application called Mobile Sensor Hub (MoSHub). It allows variety of different sensors to be connected to a mobile phone and send the data to the cloud intelligently reducing network communication. Specifically, we explore techniques that allow MoSHub to be connected to cloud based IoT middleware solutions autonomously. For our experiments, we employed Global Sensor Network (GSN) middleware to implement and evaluate our approach. Such automated configuration reduces significant amount of manual labour that need to be performed by technical experts otherwise. We also evaluated different methods that can be used to automate the configuration process.},

 abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) will connect billions of sensors deployed around the world together. This will create an ideal opportunity to build a sensing-as-a-service platform. Due to large number of sensor deployments, there would be number of sensors that can be used to sense and collect similar information. Further, due to advances in sensor hardware technology, new methods and measurements will be introduced continuously. In the IoT paradigm, selecting the most appropriate sensors which can provide relevant sensor data to address the problems at hand among billions of possibilities would be a challenge for both technical and non-technical users. In this paper, we propose the Context Awareness for Internet of Things (CA4IOT) architecture to help users by automating the task of selecting the sensors according to the problems/tasks at hand. We focus on automated configuration of filtering, fusion and reasoning mechanisms that can be applied to the collected sensor data streams using selected sensors. Our objective is to allow the users to submit their problems, so our proposed architecture understands them and produces more comprehensive and meaningful information than the raw sensor data streams generated by individual sensors.},

With the ever increasing emergence of new sensors, interfaces and mobile devices, the grand challenge is to keep up with this race in developing software drivers and wrappers for IoT things. In this paper, we examine the approaches that automate the process of developing middleware drivers/wrappers for the IoT things. We propose ASCM4GSN architecture to address this challenge efficiently and effectively. We demonstrate the proposed approach using Global Sensor Network (GSN) middleware which exemplifies a cluster of data streaming engines. The ASCM4GSN architecture significantly speeds up the wrapper development and sensor configuration process as demonstrated for Android mobile phone based sensors as well as for Sun SPOT sensors.},

The Internet of Things vision encompasses participatory sensing which is enabled using mobile phones based sensing and reasoning. In this research, we propose and demonstrate our DAM4GSN architecture to capture sensor data using sensors built into the mobile phones. Specifically, we combine an open source sensor data stream processing engine called `Global Sensor Network (GSN)' with the Android platform to capture sensor data. To achieve this goal, we proposed and developed a prototype application that can be installed on Android devices as well as a AndroidWrapper as a GSN middleware component. The process and the difficulty of manually connecting sensor devices to sensor data processing middleware systems are examined. We evaluated the performance of the system based on power consumption of the mobile client.},
